# Hangedman
Basic 'Hangman' game versus the computer.
* The pc chooses a **secret random word** from a pool. You will need to guess the word letter by letter.
* The letter you chose will be filled in the blanks if guessed correctly.
* Whenever you guess a letter that is not in the secret word you get a strike that brings you closer to losing. To show this, the PC will draw a simple stick figure of a man being hung, adding a new part to the drawing with every wrong answer up to 6 times.
> Guess the full word correctly before the hangedman is fully drawn and you win!.
